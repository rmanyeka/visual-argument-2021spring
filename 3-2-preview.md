In this preview, I wanted to have my background set and I chose a somewhat plain one. I did this to have an easier work space when I do add more elements to my visual argument. My background is blue with a needle and I used this to represent the COVID-19 vaccine that recently came out. I am not sure yet if I will keep this image since it does not portray covid-19, but I plan on adding more covid elements so hopefully the entire picture will come together soon. Some of these elements include masks, some data to show the severity of the pandemic, and the repercussions of delaying on preventative and protective measures that should have been taken seriously much earlier.  The second element I decided to add to the main words that I want to include in my argument, "Believe in Science". I had these words trying to come out of the syringe and I plan on making that more smooth in the future since this is the first draft. These will be my only words that would be featured In my visual argument because I believe those words itself can convey the message that I am trying to achieve. Space with incorporating elements of the COVID-19 pandemic I believe the words believe in science convey a strong argument to not only believe the scientists  and researchers In my visual argument because I believe those three words itself can convey the message that I am trying to achieve. Space with incorporating elements of the COVID-19 pandemic I believe the words believe in science convey a strong argument to not only believe the scientists and researchers who continue to provide valuable and life-saving information. With the new trend of misinformation I am hoping this visual argument will affect viewers in a positive way and hopefully make science less of a controversial topic hoping
